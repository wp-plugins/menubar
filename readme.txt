Configurable menus with your choice of menu templates.

With the Menubar plugin you can:

* build fully customized flat or hierarchical menus with links to homepage, frontpage, categories, category trees, static pages, page trees, single posts, and external URLs of your choice; the currently selected menu item is dynamically highlighted;

* specify where to place each menu by inserting in your theme a short line of PHP code; there is no need to remove that line if you later deactivate the plugin;

* choose one of the included menu templates to style your menus, and modify or rewrite the menu templates as you like.
