Single and multi-level menus for your WordPress site, styled with customizable menu templates.

== Description ==

With Menubar you can easily build and manage single and multi-level menus for your WordPress site.

* Build your menus choosing menu items among Home, FrontPage, Category, CategoryTree, Page, PageTree, Heading, Post, External, in any combination
* Display a menu inserting in your theme, e.g. at the end of *header.php*, the line `<?php do_action ('wp_menubar', 'your_menu_name'); ?>`
* Use the Menubar widget to display your menus in a widgetized area / sidebar (only with WordPress 2.8+)
* Style your menus using Menubar templates - a few easily customizable templates are already available, and you can add new templates without changing the plugin code
* Upgrade automatically to a newer Menubar version without losing your template customizations
