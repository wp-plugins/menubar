Single and multi-level menus for your WordPress site, styled with customizable menu templates.

== Description ==

With Menubar you can easily build and manage single and multi-level menus for your WordPress site.

* Build your menus selecting item types among Home, FrontPage, Heading, Tag, TagList, Category, CategoryTree, Page, PageTree, Post, SearchBox, External, PHP, Custom, in any combination
* Display a menu inserting in your theme, e.g. at the end of *header.php*, the line `<?php do_action ('wp_menubar', 'your_menu_name'); ?>`
* Use the *Menubar* widget to display your menus in a widget ready area or sidebar (only with WordPress 2.8 or higher)
* To style your menus, select one of the available Menubar templates, customize your selected template, or use the CSS from your theme
* Menubar templates are stored in an independent folder, so you can upgrade automatically to a new Menubar version without losing your template customizations
