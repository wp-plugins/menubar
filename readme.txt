Configurable menus with your choice of menu templates.

== Description ==

With Menubar you can easily build and manage multi-level menus for your WordPress site.

Menu item types are home, frontpage, category, category tree, static page, page tree, heading, single post, external URL, in any combination.

Each menu can be integrated in your theme with a short line of PHP code:

`<?php do_action('wp_menubar','menu_name'); ?>`

The style of your menus is controlled by Menubar templates. A few easily customizable templates are already available, and new templates can be added without changing the plugin code.

From version 3.1 your Menubar templates will be stored in the *menubar-templates* folder, so future automatic upgrades won't overwrite your customizations.

A Menubar live demo is available at the [WP Menubar demo site](http://www.dontdream.it/demo/).
