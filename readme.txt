Configurable menus with your choice of menu templates.

== Description ==

With Menubar you can easily build and manage multi-level menus for your WordPress site.

* Choose menu item types among Home, FrontPage, Category, CategoryTree, Page, PageTree, Heading, Post, External, in any combination;

* Display a menu writing the line `<?php do_action('wp_menubar','menu_name'); ?>` in your theme, e.g. in *header.php*;

* Style your menus using Menubar templates - a few easily customizable templates are already available, and new templates can be added without changing the plugin code;

* Upgrade automatically to a newer Menubar version without losing your template customizations.
