Easily build single and multi-level menus for your WordPress site, and style them with customizable menu templates.

== Description ==

With Menubar you can easily build and manage single and multi-level menus for your WordPress site.

* Choose menu item types among Home, FrontPage, Category, CategoryTree, Page, PageTree, Heading, Post, External, in any combination;
* Display a menu inserting in your theme, e.g. at the end of *header.php*, the line `<?php do_action ('wp_menubar', 'menu_name'); ?>`;
* Style your menus using Menubar templates - a few easily customizable templates are already available, and you can add new templates without changing the plugin code;
* Upgrade automatically to a newer Menubar version without losing your template customizations.
